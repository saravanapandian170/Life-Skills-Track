# Listening and Active Communication

## 1. Steps/Strategies to Do Active Listening
◦ Stop the thoughts running in your mind while listening.  
◦ Pay full attention and get involved in what the speaker is saying.  
◦ Let the other person finish speaking completely.  
◦ Do not interrupt or start thinking about your response while they are talking.  
◦ Take notes if possible.  
◦ Summarize what the other person said to show understanding.  

## 2. Key Points of Reflective Listening (According to Fisher's Model)
◦ Reflective listening is when the listener carefully listens and then **reflects back** what the speaker said.  
◦ It focuses not only on the words but also on the **feelings, thoughts, and meaning** behind them.  
◦ It is a powerful way to **show empathy** and make the speaker feel heard.  
◦ This technique helps in building **trust and deeper connection**, especially in counseling and conflict resolution.  
◦ Reflective listening makes people more **open to sharing** their thoughts and feelings.  

## 3. Obstacles in My Listening Process
◦ I often get involved in my own thoughts while listening.  
◦ I feel the urge to correct someone before they finish speaking.  
◦ I sometimes interrupt continuously because I do not know when to speak.  
◦ I focus too much on eye contact, which can make the other person uncomfortable.  

## 4. Ways to Improve Listening
◦ Try to **stop my own thoughts** and imagine the situation the speaker is describing.  
◦ Listen to understand the speaker, not just to reply or give my opinion.  
◦ Look away occasionally to avoid making the speaker uncomfortable.  
◦ After the conversation, recall and summarize what the speaker said.  

## 5. When I Switch to Passive Communication Style
◦ I tend to be passive when interacting with people who have higher authority.  
◦ It usually happens when my confidence is low.  
◦ For example, after quitting my previous job, I avoided expressing my opinions even in situations where I felt uncomfortable.  

## 6. When I Switch to Aggressive Communication Style
◦ I become aggressive when I feel irritated or disrespected.  
◦ It happens when someone says I have done nothing even though I worked hard.  
◦ I also notice it when I am asked to do tasks I do not like, for example, being asked by mom to go to the shop.  

## 7. When I Switch to Passive-Aggressive Communication Style
◦ I use passive-aggressive communication when I dislike someone's behavior but cannot express it openly.  
◦ I often use silent treatment when I feel that words cannot change the situation.  

## 8. How I Can Make My Communication Assertive
◦ Say what I think and feel **clearly and politely** without blaming anyone.  
◦ Listen carefully to the other person before I reply.  
◦ Use a **calm voice** and confident body language.  
◦ Set limits and say “no” politely when needed.
