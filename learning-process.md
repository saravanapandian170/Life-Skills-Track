# **Learning Process**
### **Question 1**
**What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.**  
● If you cannot explain a concept in simple language, you have not truly understood it.

### **Question 2**
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**  
● The comparison between the car racer and the hiker was the most interesting idea.  
● For a long time, I believed that people who grasp and remember things quickly are smart, which I am not.  
● The idea of being a hiker gave me a new perspective on slow and steady learning, which can lead to more creativity.

### **Question 3**
**What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**  
● Active mode is focusing on something that needs to be learned, helping to grasp things quickly like data stored in a cache.  
● Diffused mode is relaxing and letting the things learned in focused mode settle, like storing data on a hard disk.

### **Question 4**
**According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?**  
● Deconstruct the skill.  
● Learn enough to practice and self-correct.  
● Remove practice barriers.  
● Practice for at least 20 hours.

### **Question 5**
**What actions can you take going forward to improve your learning process?**  
● I will teach concepts in simple words to ensure understanding.  
● I will apply focused and diffused modes of thinking using the Pomodoro technique.  
● If I get stuck or take longer to understand something, I will remind myself that I am a hiker, not a racer.  
● I will recall what I study to reinforce learning.  
● I will focus on practicing a new skill for the first 20 hours without overthinking.  
● I'd rather be a fool for 20 hours than be a fool for my entire life.
